## googlmath
Go OpenGL math library

## Status
API is mostly stable. A lot of tests are missing. Some code contains errors and some is not optimized at all.
If you use this library, do yourself a favour and check if the functions you use are correct.
NOTE: The code is not checked for concurrency use (yet).
